<h1>Logic III: Modal Logic (Under Construction)</h1>
<p><em>31 Dec 2025</em></p>

<p>Modal Logic captures the possibility and necessity of things. For this post, my textbooks are <em>An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic</em> by Graham Priest and <em>An Open Introduction to Modal Logic</em> by Richard Zach. It is not possible to cover everything but this post outlines the key concepts in Modal Logic. Note that the knowledge of Set Theory and Possible Worlds is a prerequisite for Modal Logic.</p>

<h2>§3.1 K-Model</h2>

<p>We introduce two modal operators: &#9633; for <i>necessarily</i> and &#9674; for <i>possibly</i>. &#9633;P means “It is <i>necessarily</i> the case that P” and &#9674;P means “It is <i>possibly</i> the case that P.” Priest (2008, pp. 21–22) introduces the following variables for a K-Model:</p>

<p><b>Interpretation:</b> &lang;<i>W</i>, <i>R</i>, <i>v</i>&rang; where <i>W</i> is a nonempty set of possible worlds, <i>R</i> is the accessibility relation and <i>v</i> is a function that assigns a set <i>v</i>(<i>p</i>) of possible worlds to every atomic sentence <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>The idea here is complex, especially for those studying Modal Logic for the first time, as they may not be familiar with concepts such as possible worlds and accessibility relations, and the need for interpretation in the study of Modal Logic. For possible worlds, consider them as worlds in which things <i>could have been different</i> from the world we currently live in (i.e., the actual world, which is a possible world as well). For example, Kal'tsit <i>could have been alive</i> in one of the possible worlds and therefore, we say the life of Kal'tsit is <i>logically possible</i>. There is a strict definition of possible worlds but mine would suffice for now. Accessibility relations are placed between two possible worlds: <i>w</i> and <i>w'</i>. Roughly, <i>w'</i> is accessible from <i>w</i> (i.e., <i>wRw'</i>) if <i>w'</i> represents a way things could have been given what is true at <i>w</i>. Not all worlds are accessible from <i>w</i>. For example, from the actual world, worlds with logical contradictions (e.g., Kal'tsit is taller than me <i>and</i> shorter than me) are never accessible (if we are talking about logical possibility).</p>
