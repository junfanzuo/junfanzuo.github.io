<h1>The Possibility of Surviving Death</h1>
<p><em>26 Jan 2026</em></p>

<p>First and foremost, it is intuitively strange to say ‘Surviving Death’ because if you survive something, let us say, a car crash, you will still be alive after ‘Surviving the Crash’ then it is pretty pointless to say you are still alive after ‘Surviving Death’ since death marks the end of life. Three questions are raised here: (a) What is death, (b) What could you be after surviving death, and (c) Is ‘Surviving Death’ even possible? I write this post while reading Dean Zimmerman’s <i>Personal Identity and the Survival of Death</i> in <i>The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Death</i>. Hopefully I can at least give a good summary of these questions in the post.</p>

<h2>What Is Death?</h2>

<p>It is obvious to the public that death is the end of life: Kal’tsit, a person who can move around (autonomous motion), think (thought), eat (nutrition), and do all sorts of things (vital activities) that a sentient being can do, has a life<sup>1</sup>. Death, then, comes into play and Kal’tsit turns into a person (or more precisely, a corpse) who cannot move around, think, eat, and cannot do all sorts of things that a sentient being can do, has no life. Therefore, death seems to be an event where Kal’tsit loses the capacity to perform all the life-functions. However, this account of death is problematic: Consider a frozen embryo. Is the embryo dead? Clearly it is dead if we accept the current account of death because the embryo does not have the capacity to perform life-functions. But we froze the embryo for future use in the in vitro fertilization. Won’t the embryo possess the potential of performing life-functions and is it just not actualized yet (Luper, 2024)? Therefore, if we claim the embryo is dead, then how could a dead thing be brought to life in the future? Death, in conclusion, is not necessarily the loss of the capacity to perform the life-functions.</p>

<h2>What Could You Be After Surviving Death?</h2>

<p>What could you be after surviving death? Before we consider questions like ‘how to equalize subject <i>x</i> at time <i>t</i> and subject <i>y</i> at time <i>t’</i>, we need to know what subject <i>x</i> is in the first place. When Kal’tsit utters the word ‘I’, what is Kal’tsit referring to? The person who named Kal’tsit? Not exactly because ‘I’ in the case is referring to herself while ‘the person who named Kal’tsit’ forms a group of people who named Kal’tsit<sup>2</sup>. If ‘I’ is not the name plus the person, can ‘I’ be referring to the physical, material body of Kal’tsit? This is the materialist account of human beings. Each person is composed of physical flesh, specifically the body and brain. However, we do have consciousness, an immaterial substance that allows us to think. If we accept materialism, how is it possible for a physical entity to possess a non-physical entity<sup>3</sup>? Consciousness does not jump out just because you put all the physical parts together in the proper place. Therefore, dualists argue that there must be an immaterial entity responsible for our mental activities. It could be a soul, or other non-physical substances. Zimmerman (2013) introduced two types of dualism (i.e., Simple Dualism and Compound Dualism) to define a human being. Roughly, simple dualism is the doctrine that ‘I’ am identical to my soul, while compound dualism takes human beings to be the compound of body and soul.</p>

<p>Now what could you be after death? The material body will decay if your corpse is not preserved by cryonics. Based on materialism, could we claim that your physical body is identical to the corpse? The Identity of Indiscernibles tells us that for all <i>F</i>, \( (Fx \leftrightarrow Fy) \to (x = y) \), where <i>F</i> is a property, and <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> are objects. Therefore, if I can find <i>F</i> possessed by your physical body but not your corpse, then they are not identical. In this case, <i>F</i> could be body heat, and thus you could never be your physical body after death. Materialists’ account of human beings does not hold, at least, for those who are dead. Then are you a corpse, or a corpse plus a soul? The Aristotelian account of the soul is that the soul is the first actuality of a natural body having life in potentiality. The thought here is that if Kal’tsit possesses the soul (this is obvious by Aristotelian’s compound dualism), then Kal’tsit will possess the functional disposition for all sorts of life-functions. However, it seems unlikely that a corpse will perform any of life-functions we mentioned previously, so it is hard to claim that, after death, you are a corpse with a soul. </p>

<h2>Is ‘Surviving Death’ Even Possible?</h2>

<p>Zimmerman (2013) argued that both materialism and dualism are compatible with the possibility of surviving death. The Falling Elevator Model proposed by Zimmerman allows materialists who embrace biological criteria<sup>4</sup> to survive bodily death through divine (God’s) intervention. An analogy is a cartoon character in a plummeting elevator from crashing, jumps upward at the last instant and survives while the elevator is destroyed (Zimmerman, 2013). The model argues that, precisely at the moment when biological death would terminate the organism’s causal life processes (i.e., the self-maintaining activities of cells and organs), God miraculously causes each constituent particle of the dying body to transfer an exact duplicate to a distant location. The organism’s vital processes like the chain of immanent causation constitutive of its ongoing existence seamlessly jump to and continue within this new parcel of matter to form a healthy, functioning body, while the original matter lapses into a corpse. This preserves strict biological continuity without the reliance on mere psychological causation or external reassembly, and therefore satisfies the robust biological criterion of personal identity. Although this model requires miraculous violation of ordinary physics like the particle replacement process, it demonstrates that materialism is not a metaphysical barrier to post-mortem survival if a resourceful deity ensures the causal leap exists.</p>

<p>For dualists, the survival of bodily death is metaphysically straightforward, as persons are either identical to or essentially involve an immaterial soul distinct from the physical body whose persistence does not depend upon the ongoing functioning of biological processes. Under simple dualism, the human person just is the soul and thus God needs only sustain the soul’s existence after death, perhaps in a temporarily diminished state lacking full cognitive faculties to ensure the person’s continued being. God may then reunite it with a resurrected body equipped with a suitable brain for restoring mentality. For compound (Thomistic) dualists, where the person is a soul-body composite, surviving death either requires a temporary ‘gappy’ existence (i.e., the person ceases briefly and recommences upon reunification) or treating the indestructible soul as an identity-preserving entity around which God reorganizes matter in resurrection.</p>

<h2>Why God?</h2>

<p>Zimmerman emphasizes the existence of God to account for the possibility of surviving death. However, for atheists, it seems that presupposing an omnipotent, divine being is problematic, or hard to accept, at least. Note that we are not talking about the <i>actualization</i> of surviving death, but its <i>possibility</i>. Surviving death does not occur because of the existence of God, but we are merely talking about the metaphysical compatibility that neither dualism nor materialism logically or physically precludes this kind of survival if God intervenes with miracles. Mental activities like thought, memory, and consciousness are empirically dependent on a functioning brain. When the brain irreversibly ceases with a bodily death, those capacities naturally terminate whether one is a dualist or a materialist. Without God’s intervention to sustain, restore, or transfer those capacities, meaningful personal survival like continuing as a thinking, remembering self is unlikely on either view as Zimmerman states explicitly, “<i>Without God in the picture, dualism by itself would not lead us to expect any very meaningful kind of survival of death</i>,” and materialism is even ‘trickier’ (Zimmerman, 2013, p.99).</p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p><sup>1</sup> This is Aristotle’s functionalism. Here life is categorized as a property that all the living things possess. We say a thing has a life when it can perform functions like autonomous motion, sensation, and nutrition, etc. However, functionalism is problematic. If a list of life-functions exists, then how many functions do I need to properly perform in order to be qualified as a living being? An AI-driven robot is likely to have autonomous motion but is it alive? Read Luper (2024).</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup> What if my name is very rare so that no one shares exactly the same name with me? In that case, are ‘I’ and the name equal? Nāgārjuna’s no-self may answer this question.</p>

        <p><sup>4</sup> Defined as “<i>A person x who exists at a time t is the same person as a person y who exists at a later time t* if, and only if: the matter making up the person x at t comprises all of the matter caught up in the homeostatic biological event known as the life of an organism; and the matter of y at the later time t* also comprises all the matter that is then caught up in the very same life</i>” (Zimmerman, 2013, p. 112).</p>
