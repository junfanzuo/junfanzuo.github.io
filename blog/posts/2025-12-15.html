<h1>Being A Pyrrhonist Does Not Always Give You Tranquillity</h1>
<p><em>15 Dec 2025</em></p>

<p>Pyrrhonian scepticism seeks the state of being free from anxiety and worry or tranquillity (ataraxia) through the suspension of judgment (epoche). This essay will first briefly introduce Pyrrhonian scepticism to explain how one becomes a Pyrrhonian sceptic. It will then discuss how Pyrrhonian scepticism can lead to tranquillity. The essay argues that Sextus Empiricus’s claim that the ultimate goal, tranquillity, can always be achieved by being a Pyrrhonian Sceptic, is not plausible.</p>
